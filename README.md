advent
======

This is a collection of short minigames/microgames meant as a sort of advent calendar for 2013. The games here aren't meant to be polished; instead they're just simple explorations of mechanics and interaction. Think more WarioWare on the web. I try to limit myself to working for no more than four hours on each game.

This project was inspired significantly by [Anna Anthropy](http://auntiepixelante.com/)'s book *[Rise of the Videogame Zinesters](http://www.amazon.com/Rise-Videogame-Zinesters-Drop-outs-Housewives/dp/1609803728)*. I'm interested in seeing where a more punk or zine-influenced take on games will lead and hope that a project like this might inspire someone who's less involved in the "real" game industry to take a chance on self publishing some crazy, but personal, things. 

Method to the Madness
---------------------

TBD. Games go in games/ -- one per folder. Things for publication go in publish/.

Everything is published via GitHub Pages and can be found [here](http://jculpon.github.io/advent/). To see the content for that site, look at the gh-pages branch. I use the excellent tool [ghp-import](http://davisp.github.io/ghp-import/) to import content to the site.

Contributing
------------

These games are meant as personal expressions, and as such I'm not interested in wholesale game contributions. I do, however, love patches and suggestions for improvements. Feel free to open a pull request if you notice something that's wrong.
