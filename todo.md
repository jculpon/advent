Rough TODOs for Advent Games
============================


Game Idealets
-------------

- [ ] Explode some text, win when text is all exploded
- [ ] Heat: asteroids clone where firing/moving builds up heat. Dissipating heat attracts enemies. Too much heat melts you.
- [ ] Twine game about the "you meet the weirdest people in the games industry" talk
- [ ] Trans* Erasure: A game where you literally erase trans* people (or their identities? pronouns?) from text

Research
--------

- [ ] Does a Stencyl equivelent for the web exist?
- [ ] What are other folks doing with twine?
- [ ] Canvas? 
- [ ] WebGL?

Project Homepage
----------------

- [ ] Basic text: what this is, link to calendar
- [ ] Links back to other me stuff
- [ ] Styled decently

Calendar
--------

- [ ] Unstyled list of links
- [ ] Calendarish layout
- [ ] Basic Styling (pixelish?)

Promotion
---------

- [ ] Figure out sites that might be interested in the idea
- [ ] Talk to indie games blogs?
- [ ] Twitter at folks?
- [ ] Blog?
