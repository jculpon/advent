* Gameplay
** Main loop
Player loads screen, greeted with some text and a progress indicator.
Player "erases" a word or term from the text that's trans-related and
the progress indicator fills. 
When progress indicator is full, move on to the next stage (new text)   
** Considerations
*** Text selection
Might be good to find a story or something that is easy to split into
sections and yet people would want to finish.

Would also be cool to progress from small amount of erasing to a lot?

Maybe something prominent in history? Some other interesting thing
*** How do you erase?
Rub back and forth over word?
Click word?
Delete word from <textarea>?
What happens when you erase the wrong thing?
*** Feedback
** Thoughts on reflection from last night
*** Acting like a code chauvanist
    just mark up the data, there won't be much. Hide it in invisible divs
